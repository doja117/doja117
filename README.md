Yo! (Yo!)
MF DOOM (Mr. Fantastik)
Mr. Fantastik (Villain)
What up, nigga? (Ain't nuttin', what's the word?)
What's cracking, boy? (Same ol' shit, kid)
Man (different day, you know?)
These rap snitches, man, shit is bugged out, man
What the fuck, man? (Shit, you telling me)
Niggas running their mouth, telling e'rything, e'rything (critical)                       
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness                                                                                                            
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here                                                                                    
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years, uh
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years
Type profile low, like A in "Paid in Full"
Attract heavy cash 'cause the game's centrifugal
Mr. Fantastik, long dough like elastic
Guard my life with twin Glocks that's made out of plastic
Can't stand a brown-nosing nigga, fake ass bastard
Admiring my style, tour bus through Manhattan
Plotting, plan the quickest, my flow's the sickest
My hoes be the thickest, my 'dro the stickiest
Street nigga, stamped and bonafide
When beef jump niggas come get me 'cause they know I ride
True to the ski mask, New York's my origin
Play a fake gangsta like a old accordion
According to him, when the D's rushed in
Complication from the wire testimony was thin
Caused his man to go up north, the ball hit 'em again
Lame rap snitch nigga even told on the Mexican
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years
True, there's rules to this shit, fools dare care
Everybody wanna rule the world with tears for fear
Yeah, yeah, tell 'em, tell it on the mountain hill
Running up they mouth bill, everybody doubting still
Informer, keep it up and get tested
Pop through your bubble vest or double-breasted
"He keep a lab down south in the little beast"
So much heat you woulda thought it was the Middle East
A little grease always keeps the wheels a-spinning
Like sitting on 23's to get the squealers grinning
Hitting on many trees, feel real linen
Spitting on enemies, get the steel for tin men
Where no brains but gum flap
He said his gun clap, then he fled after one slap (pap!)
Son, shut your trap, save it for the bitches
Mmm, delicious, rap snitch kisses
You know what I'm saying? (It's terrible)
Crazy, man, I'm just analyzing this whole game
This is bugged out, man, niggas is snitching
Telling on they own self (it's a horror, yo)
Fuck around and get everybody bagged, man
(Atrocities) fuck around and get yo' mama bagged, nigga
You know your grandmama used to be bootlegging
Fake hustling nigga, heheheheheheh, haha
Perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
